In order to be able to run the program correctly. Pandas and Scikit were installed so I could be able to run the program and handle the datafiles efficently
I commented out the second portion of the code that contained the program to display the F1Score and accuracy for the first portion of the project.
It also took awhile to be able to successfully compile because of the parameters that I chose. I was able to get the results around 40min of compile time but based on hardware, the time could vary to become even longer.
The same thing also occured for the MNIST compiling which I didnt expect. However, I was able to obtain results from my set up experiments.
I used excel to organize and analyzed the data based on the questions in the project report. MAIN FILE IS IN THE .VENV FILE TO COMPILE WITH
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN CODE:
I have the first portion of code uncommented. That is for the MNIST compiling. The compiling will take awhile
I also have the second portion of code commented out. This is where the experimenting occured where I also had my file route that I used to get the data from the folder
1. Compile for MNIST results
2. Comment out MNIST code and uncomment experiement code (I made a comment for the cutoff point for both portions of code)
3. Adjust file route if necessary

I HAVE THE CSV DATA FILES USED TO TEST MY CODE BUT DID NOT PUT THEM IN THIS REPOSITORY
